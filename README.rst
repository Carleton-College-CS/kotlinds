Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Java: The Interactive Edition
========================================================================================

This book began as a paper book, first published by Franklin Beedle & Associates back in 2005.  Written by Brad Miller and David Ranum.  We are grateful for the vision of Jim Leisy who gave us permission to take our text and publish it online as an interactive textbook.

The current repository has been translated to Java by J. David Eisenberg for a course taught at Evergreen Valley College in San Jos√©, California. Any errors in the book are exclusively his.
