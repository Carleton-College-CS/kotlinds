  <title>Visualizing Recursion</title>
  <p>In the previous section we looked at some problems that were easy to
            solve using recursion; however, it can still be difficult to find a
            mental model or a way of visualizing what is happening in a recursive
            function. This can make recursion difficult for people to grasp. In this
            section we will look at a couple of examples of using recursion to draw
            some interesting pictures. As you watch these pictures take shape you
            will get some new insight into the recursive process that may be helpful
            in cementing your understanding of recursion.</p>
  <p>The tool we will use for our illustrations is called turtle graphics. You will need to put the
    <c>World.java</c> and <c>Turtle.java</c> classes in the same directory as your Java programs
    for these examples. Here is the metaphor that turtle graphics uses: You can create a turtle and the turtle can move forward,
            move backward, turn left, turn right, etc. The turtle can have its tail up or
            down. When the turtle's tail is down and the turtle moves, it draws a
            line as it moves. To increase the artistic value of the turtle, you can
            change the width of the tail as well as the color of the ink the tail is
            dipped in.</p>
          <aside><p>Thanks to Luther Tychonievich, who wrote the World and Turtle classes and released them to the public domain.</p></aside>
  <p>Here is an example to illustrate some <c>turtle</c> graphics basics. We
            will use the World and Turtle module to draw a spiral recursively.
            <xref ref="lst-turtle-spiral"/> shows how it is done. In line 4, we create a world (that is, a winow) for the turtle to draw in, and then we create a new turtle within that world on line 5.</p>
          <aside><p>Programmers seem to like choosing cute names for turtles.</p></aside>
          <p>When you run the program, you see the turtle's movement. Line 7 sets the time (in seconds) between turtle commands. Line 8 makes the window visible. Then, in line 9, we call the <c>drawSpiral</c> method. Finally, in line 10, we hide the image of the turtle so we can see the drawing in its entirety.</p>

          <p>Now let us turn our attention to the <c>drawSpiral</c> method.
            The base case for this simple function is when the length of the line we
            want to draw, as given by the <c>lineLength</c> parameter, is reduced to zero or
            less. If the length of the line is longer than zero, we instruct the
            turtle to go forward by <c>lineLength</c> units and then turn right 90 degrees.
            The recursive step is when we call <c>drawSpiral</c> again with a reduced
            length. </p>

  <p>That is really about all the turtle graphics you need to know in order
            to make some pretty impressive drawings. For our next program we
            will turn to fractals. Fractals come from a branch of
            mathematics, and have much in common with recursion. By definition,
            a <term>fractal</term> has the same basic shape no matter how much you magnify it.
            Some examples from nature are the
            coastlines of continents, snowflakes, mountains, and even trees or
            shrubs. The fractal nature of many of these natural phenomena makes it
            possible for programmers to generate very realistic looking scenery for
            computer-generated movies. In our next example we will generate a
            fractal tree.</p>
  <p>To understand how this is going to work it is helpful to think of how we
            might describe a tree using a fractal vocabulary. Remember that we said
            above that a fractal is something that looks the same at all different
            levels of magnification. If we translate this to trees and shrubs, we
            might say that even a small twig has the same shape and characteristics
            as a whole tree. Using this idea we could say that a tree is a trunk,
            with a smaller tree going off to the right and another smaller tree
            going off to the left. If you think of this definition recursively, it
            means that we will apply the recursive definition of a tree to both of
            the smaller left and right trees.</p>
  <p>Let's translate this idea to some Java code. <xref ref="recursion_lst-fractree"/>
            shows how we can use our turtle to generate a fractal tree. Let's look at
            the code a bit more closely. You will see that on lines 5 and 7 we are
            making a recursive call. On line 5 we make the recursive call right
            after the turtle turns to the right by 20 degrees; this is the right
            tree mentioned above. Then in line 7 the turtle makes another recursive
            call, but this time after turning left by 40 degrees. The reason the
            turtle must turn left by 40 degrees is that it needs to undo the
            original 20-degree turn to the right and then do an additional 20-degree
            turn to the left in order to draw the left tree. Also notice that each
            time we make a recursive call to <c>tree</c> we subtract some amount from
            the <c>branchLen</c> parameter; this is to make sure that the recursive
            trees get smaller and smaller. You should also recognize the initial
            <c>if</c> statement on line 2 as a check for the base case of <c>branchLen</c>
            getting too small.</p>

  <p>The complete program for this tree example is shown in <xref ref="lst-complete-tree"/>.  Before you run
            the code think about how you expect to see the tree take shape. Look at
            the recursive calls and think about how this tree will unfold. Will it
            be drawn symmetrically with the right and left halves of the tree taking
            shape simultaneously? Will it be drawn right side first then left side?</p>

  <p>Notice how each branch point on the tree corresponds to a recursive
            call, and notice how the tree is drawn to the right all the way down to
            its shortest twig. You can see this in <xref ref="recursion_fig-tree1"/>. Now, notice
            how the program works its way back up the trunk until the entire right
            side of the tree is drawn. You can see the right half of the tree in
            <xref ref="recursion_fig-tree2"/>. Then the left side of the tree is drawn, but not by
            going as far out to the left as possible. Rather, once again the entire
            right side of the left tree is drawn until we finally make our way out
            to the smallest twig on the left, shown in <xref ref="recursion_fig-tree-complete"/>.</p>

  <p>This basic tree program is just a starting point for you, and you will
            notice that the tree does not look particularly realistic because nature
            is just not as symmetrical as a computer program. The exercises at the end
            of the chapter will give you some ideas for how to explore some
            interesting options to make your tree look more realistic.</p>

          <note>
            <title>Java Note</title>
            <p>In line 1 of <xref ref="lst-complete-tree"/>, we import <c>java.awt.Color</c> (<q>awt</q> stands for <q>Abstract Windowing Toolkit</q>, one of Java's basic graphics modules). This class lets us create customized colors.
              On line 9, we create a new color by giving its red, green, and blue components on a scale of 0.0 (none) to
              1.0 (all). Our color will have no red, 50% green, and no blue. This results in a dark green. You can also specify the red, green, and blue components as integers on a scale of 0 to 255.</p>

    <title>Self Check</title>
    <p>Modify the recursive tree program using one or all of the following
                ideas:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Modify the thickness of the branches so that as the <c>branch_len</c>
            gets smaller, the line gets thinner. (Use the <c>setPenWidth</c> method. Its parameter gives the width of the line in pixels, and is a <c>double</c>.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Modify the color of the branches so that as the <c>branch_len</c> gets
                        very short it is colored like a leaf.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Modify the angle used in turning the turtle so that at each branch
                        point the angle is selected at random in some range. For example
                        choose the angle between 15 and 45 degrees. Play around to see
                        what looks good.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Modify the <c>branchLen</c> recursively so that instead of always
                        subtracting the same amount you subtract a random amount in some
                        range.</p>
