  <title>Binary Heap Implementation</title>

    <title>The Structure Property</title>
    <p>In order to make our heap work efficiently, we will take advantage of
                the logarithmic nature of the binary tree to represent our heap. In order to guarantee logarithmic
                performance, we must keep our tree balanced. A balanced binary tree has
                roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the
                root. In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a
                <term>complete binary tree</term>. A complete binary tree is a tree in which each
                level has all of its nodes. The exception to this is the bottom level of
                the tree, which we fill in from left to right. <xref ref="i19_id1fig-comptree"/>
                shows an example of a complete binary tree.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent
                it using a single list. We do not need to use nodes and references or
                even lists of lists. Because the tree is complete, the left child of a
                parent (at position <m>p</m>) is the node that is found in position
                <m>2p + 1</m> in the list. Similarly, the right child of the parent is at
                position <m>2p + 2</m> in the list. To find the parent of any node in
                the tree, we can use Java's integer division. Given that a node
                is at position <m>n</m> in the list, the parent is at position
                <m>(n - 1) / 2</m>. <xref ref="i19_id2fig-heaporder"/> shows a complete binary tree
                and also gives the list representation of the tree.  Note the <m>2p + 1</m> and <m>2p + 2</m> relationship between
                parent and children. The list
                representation of the tree, along with the full structure property,
                allows us to efficiently traverse a complete binary tree using only a
                few simple mathematical operations. We will see that this also leads to
                an efficient implementation of our binary heap.</p>

    <title>The Heap Order Property</title>
    <p>The method that we will use to store items in a heap relies on
                maintaining the heap order property. The <term>heap order property</term> is as
                follows: in a heap, for every node <m>x</m> with parent <m>p</m>,
                the key in <m>p</m> is smaller than or equal to the key in
                <m>x</m>. <xref ref="i19_id2fig-heaporder"/> also illustrates a complete binary
                tree that has the heap order property.</p>

    </figure>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="trees_heap-operations">
    <title>Heap Operations</title>
    <p>We will begin our implementation of a binary heap with the constructor.
                Since the entire binary heap can be represented by a single list, all
                the constructor will do is initialize the list.
                <xref ref="trees_lst-heap1a"/> shows the Java code for the constructor.</p>
            <listing xml:id="trees_lst-heap1a"><program language="java"><input>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BinaryHeap&lt;T&gt; {
    ArrayList&lt;T&gt; items;

    public BinaryHeap() {
        this.items = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
    }
    // more code here...
}
</input></program></listing>

    <p>The next method we will implement is <c>insert</c>. The easiest, and most
                efficient, way to add an item to a list is to append the item to
                the end of the list. The good news about appending is that it guarantees
                that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about
                appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure
                property. However, it is possible to write a method that will allow us
                to regain the heap structure property by comparing the newly added item
                with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then
                we can swap the item with its parent. <xref ref="fig-percup"/> shows the
                series of swaps needed to percolate the newly added item up to its
                proper position in the tree.</p>

    <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-percup">
      <caption>Percolate the New Node up to Its Proper Position</caption>
      <image source="Trees/Figures/percUp.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Notice that when we percolate an item up, we are restoring the heap
                property between the newly added item and the parent. We are also
                preserving the heap property for any siblings. Of course, if the newly
                added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level.
                In fact, we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the
                tree. <xref ref="trees_lst-heap-percolate-up"/> shows the <c>percolateUp</c> method, which
                percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to
                maintain the heap property. This method is <c>private</c> as it is an internal operation.
                The parent of the current node
                can be computed by subtracting 1 from the index of the current node and dividing the result by 2.</p>

    <p>We are now ready to write the <c>insert</c> method (see <xref ref="trees_lst-heap-insert"/>). Most of the work in the
                <c>insert</c> method is really done by <c>percolateUp</c>. Once a new item is
                appended to the tree, <c>percolateUp</c> takes over and positions the new item
                properly.</p>

            <p>First, let's define a couple of convenience methods to make the code more readable, one that compares two items in the heap and another for swapping two items given their indexes:</p>

            <listing xml:id="trees_lst-convenience"><caption>Convenience Methods</caption><program language="java"><input>
    private int compareItemsAt(int index1, int index2) {
        return heap.get(index1).compareTo(heap.get(index2));
    }

    private void swapItemsAt(int index1, int index2) {
        T temporary = heap.get(index1);
        heap.set(index1, heap.get(index2));
        heap.set(index2, temporary);
    }
    </input></program></listing>

    <p>Now the methods for percolating up and inserting:</p>

    <listing xml:id="trees_lst-heap-percolate-up">
        <caption>The <c>percolateUp</c> Method</caption>
        <program language="java" line-numbers="yes"><input>
    private void percolateUp(int index) {
        while ((index &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (index - 1) / 2 >= 0) {
            int parentIndex = (index - 1) / 2;
            if (compareItemsAt(index, parentIndex) &lt; 0) {
                swapItemsAt(index, parentIndex);
            }
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    </input></program></listing>

        <note>
        <title>Java Note</title>
        <p>The comparison for <c>index &gt; 0</c> in line 2 is required because when <c>index</c> is zero, <c>(index - 1) / 2</c> evaluates to zero in Java.</p>
    </note>

    <listing xml:id="trees_lst-heap-insert"><caption>The <c>insert</c> Method</caption>
        <program language="java" line-numbers="yes"><input>
    public void insert(T item) {
        heap.add(item);
        percolateUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }
    </input></program></listing>


    <p>With the <c>insert</c> method properly defined, we can now look at the <c>delete</c> method. Since the heap property requires that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree, finding the minimum item is easy. The hard part of <c>delete</c> is restoring full compliance with the heap structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed. We can restore our heap in two steps.</p>

    <p>First, we will restore the root item by taking the last item in the list and moving it to the root position. Moving the last item maintains our heap structure property. However, we have probably destroyed the heap order property of our binary heap. Second, we will restore the heap order property by pushing the new root node down the tree to its proper position. <xref ref="fig-perc-down"/> shows the series of swaps needed to move the new root node to its proper position in the heap.</p>

    <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-perc-down">
      <caption>Percolating the Root Node down the Tree</caption>
      <image source="Trees/Figures/percDown.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
    </figure>

    <p>In order to maintain the heap order property, we need to swap
                the root with its smaller child that is less than the root. After the initial
                swap, we may repeat the swapping process with a node and its children
                until the node is swapped into a position on the tree where it is
                already less than both children. The code for percolating a node down
                the tree is found in the <c>percolateDown</c> and <c>getSmallerChild</c> methods in
                <xref ref="trees_lst-heap4"/>.</p>
    <listing xml:id="trees_lst-heap4">

    private void percolateDown(int index) {
        while (2 * index + 1 &lt; heap.size()) {
            int smallerChild = getSmallerChild(index);
            if (compareItemsAt(index, smallerChild) > 0) {
                swapItemsAt(index, smallerChild);
            } else {
                break;
            }
            index = smallerChild;
        }
    }

    private int getSmallerChild(int index) {
        if (2 * index + 2 &gt; heap.size() - 1) {
            return 2 * index + 1;
        }
        if (compareItemsAt(2 * index + 1, 2 * index + 2) &lt; 0) {
            return 2 * index + 1;
        }
        return 2 * index + 2;

    <p>To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to
                build an entire heap from a list of keys. The first method you might
                think of may be like the following. Given a list of keys, you could
                build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are
                starting with an empy list, it is sorted and you could use
                binary search to find the right position to insert the next key at a
                cost of approximately <m>O(\log{n})</m> operations. However, remember
                that inserting an item in the middle of the list may require
                <m>O(n)</m> operations to shift the rest of the list over to make
                room for the new key. Therefore, to insert <m>n</m> keys into the
                heap would require a total of <m>O(n \log{n})</m> operations.
                However, if we start with an entire list then we can build the whole
                heap in <m>O(n)</m> operations. <xref ref="trees_lst-heap6"/> shows the code
                to build the entire heap.</p>
            <listing xml:id="trees_lst-heap6"><program language="java"><input>
    public void heapify(T[] nonHeap) {
        heap = new ArrayList&gt;T&gt;(); // eliminate old data

        if (nonHeap.length != 0) {
            // copy non-heap into the new heap
            for (int i = 0; i &gt; nonHeap.length; i++) {
                heap.add(nonHeap[i]);
            }

            int currIndex = heap.size() / 2 - 1;
            while (currIndex >= 0) {
                percolateDown(currIndex);
                currIndex = currIndex - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-buildheap">
      <caption>Building a Heap from the List [9, 6, 5, 2, 3]</caption>
      <image source="Trees/Figures/buildheap.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
    </figure>
    <p><xref ref="fig-buildheap"/> shows the swaps that the <c>heapify</c> method
                makes as it moves the nodes in an initial tree of [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] into
                their proper positions. Although we start out in the middle of the tree
                and work our way back toward the root, the <c>percolateDown</c> method ensures
                that the largest child is always moved down the tree. Because the heap is a
                complete binary tree, any nodes past the halfway point will be leaves
                and therefore have no children. Notice that when <c>i = 0</c>, we are
                percolating down from the root of the tree, so this may require multiple
                swaps. As you can see in the rightmost two trees of
                <xref ref="fig-buildheap"/>, first the 9 is moved out of the root position,
                but after 9 is moved down one level in the tree, <c>percolateDown</c> ensures
                that we check the next set of children farther down in the tree to
                ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go. In this case it results in
                a second swap with 3. Now that 9 has been moved to the lowest level of
                the tree, no further swapping can be done. It is useful to compare the
                list representation of this series of swaps with the tree representation
                shown in <xref ref="fig-buildheap"/></p>

    <p>The assertion that we can build the heap in <m>O(n)</m> may seem a
                bit mysterious at first, and a proof is beyond the scope of this book.
                However, the key to understanding that you can build the heap in
                <m>O(n)</m> is to remember that the <m>\log{n}</m> factor is
                derived from the height of the tree. For most of the work in
                <c>heapify</c>, the tree is shorter than <m>\log{n}</m>.</p>

    <p>Using the fact that you can build a heap from a list in <m>O(n)</m>
                time, you will construct a sorting algorithm that uses a heap and sorts
                a list in <m>O(n\log{n})</m> as an exercise at the end of this
                chapter.</p>
