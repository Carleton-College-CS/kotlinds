  <title>Maps Revisited: Skip Lists</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>One of the most versatile collections available in Java is the
            <term>map</term>. Maps, often referred to as <term>dictionaries</term>, store a
            collection of key-value pairs. The key, which must be unique, is
            assigned an association with a particular data value. Given a key, it is
            possible to ask the map for the corresponding associated data value.
            The abilities to put a key-value pair into the map and then look up a
            data value associated with a given key are the fundamental operations
            that all maps must provide.</p>
          <p>For example, <xref ref="fig-mappic"/> shows a map containing key-value
            pairs. In this case, the keys are integers and the values are small,
            two-character words. From a logical perspective, there is no inherent
            order or organization within the pairs themselves. However, as the
            example shows, if a key (93) is provided to the map, the associated
            value (be) is returned.</p>

    <title>The Map Abstract Data Type</title>
    <p>The map abstract data type is defined by the following structure and
                operations. The structure of a map, as described above, is a collection
                of key-value pairs where values can be accessed via their associated
                key. The map operations are given below:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><c>Map()</c> creates a new map that is empty. It needs no parameters and
                        returns an empty map.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>put(key,value)</c> adds a new key-value pair to the map. It needs the
                        key and the associated value and returns nothing. Assume the key is
                        not already in the map.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><c>get(key)</c> searches for the key in the map and returns the
                        associated value. It needs the key and returns a value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It should be noted that there are a number of other possible operations
                that we could add to the map abstract data type. We will explore these
                in the exercises.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="advanced_implementing-a-dictionary-in-python">
    <title>Implementing a Map in Java</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>We have already seen a number of interesting ways to implement the map
      idea. In <xref ref="chapter-sort-search"/> we
                considered the hash table as a means of providing map behavior. Given a
                set of keys and a hash function, we could place the keys in a collection
                that allowed us to search and retrieve the associated data value. Our
                analysis showed that this technique could potentially yield an
                <m>O(1)</m> search. However, performance degraded due to issues such as
                table size, collisions, and collision resolution strategy.</p>
    <p>In <xref ref="chapter-trees"/> we considered a binary search tree as a
                way to store such a collection. In this case the keys were placed in the
                tree such that searching could be done in <m>O(\log n)</m>. However,
                this was only true if the tree was balanced; that is, the left and the
                right subtrees were all of similar size. Unfortunately, depending on the
                order of insertion, the keys could end up being skewed to the right or
                to the left. In this case the search again degrades.</p>
    <p>The problem we would like to address here is to come up with an
                implementation that has the advantages of an efficient search without
                the drawbacks described above. One such possibility is called a <term>skip
                  list</term>. <xref ref="fig-initskiplist"/> shows a possible skip list for
                the collection of key-value pairs shown in <xref ref="fig-mappic"/> (the reason for saying
                <q>possible</q> will become apparent later). As you can see, a skip list is
                basically a two-dimensional linked list where the links all go forward
                (to the right) or down. The <em>head</em> of the list can be seen in the
                upper left corner. Note that this is the only entry point into the skip
                list structure.</p>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-initskiplist">
      <caption>An Example Skip List</caption>
      <image source="Advanced/Figures/initskiplist.png" width="50%" alt="An Example Skip List"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Before moving on to the details of skip-list processing it will be
      useful to explain some vocabulary. <xref ref="fig-vocab1"/> shows that
                the majority of the skip list structure consists of a collection of data
                nodes, each of which holds a key and an associated value. In addition,
                there are two references from each data node. <xref ref="fig-skipdatanode"/>
                shows a detailed view of a single data node.</p>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-vocab1">

      <caption>A Single Data Node</caption>
      <image source="Advanced/Figures/datanode.png" width="50%" alt="A Single Data Node"/>
    </figure>
    <p><xref ref="fig-vocab2"/> shows two different vertical columns. The
                leftmost column consists of a linked list of header nodes. Each header
                node holds two references called <c>down</c> and <c>next</c>. The <c>next</c>
                reference refers to a linked list of data nodes. The <c>down</c> reference
                refers to the next lower header node. A detailed view of a header node
                can be seen in <xref ref="fig-headernode"/>.</p>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-vocab2">
      <caption>Header Nodes and Towers</caption>
      <image source="Advanced/Figures/vocabskiplist2.png" width="50%" alt="Header Nodes and Towers"/>
    </figure>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-headernode">
      <caption>Each Header Node Holds Two References</caption>
      <image source="Advanced/Figures/headernode.png" width="50%" alt="Each Header Node Holds Two References"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The columns of data nodes are known as <term>towers</term>. Towers are linked
                together by the <c>down</c> reference in the data node. We can see that
                each tower corresponds to a particular key-value pair, and towers can
                have different heights. We will explain how the height of the tower is
                determined later when we consider how to add data to the skip list.</p>
    <p>Finally, <xref ref="fig-vocab3"/> shows a horizontal collection of
                nodes. If you look closely, you will notice that each level is actually
                an ordered linked list of data nodes where the order is maintained by
                the key. Each linked list is given a name, commonly referred to as its
                <term>level</term>. Levels are named starting with 0 at the lowest row. Level 0
                consists of the entire collection of nodes. Every key-value pair must be
                present in the level-0 linked list. However, as we move up to higher
                levels, we see that the number of nodes decreases. This is one of the
                important characteristics of a skip list and will lead to an efficient
                search. Again, it can be seen that the number of nodes at each level is
                directly related to the height of the towers.</p>
    <figure align="" xml:id="fig-vocab3">
      <caption>Each Horizontal Group of Data Nodes Is a Level</caption>
      <image source="Advanced/Figures/vocabskiplist3.png" width="50%" alt="Each Horizontal Group of Data Nodes Is a Level"/>
    </figure>
    <p>While we could implement two different classes for <c>HeaderNode</c> and <c>DataNode</c>, we will take the more convenient (or rather, hack-ish) option of creating only a <q>Skip List Node</q> <c>SLNode</c>. This will avoid needing to define <c>DataNode</c> as a subclass of <c>HeaderNode</c> with all the interesting casts and compile-time checking that Java would enforce. When we create a <c>SLNode</c> as a header, its key and value fields will both be <c>null</c>.</p>

    <p>This class can be
      constructed in the same fashion as for simple linked lists. An <c>SLNode</c> node consists of two references,
                <c>next</c> and <c>down</c>, both of which are initialized to <c>null</c> in the
                constructor (see <xref ref="lst_headnode"/>), and a <c>key</c> and <c>value</c> field, which are null. We also provide a constructor that lets you initialize the key and value:</p>

<p>The constructor for the entire skip list is shown in <xref ref="lst_constructor"/>, as well as the getters and setters for the <c>head</c> property. When a skip list is
                created, there are no data and therefore no header nodes. The head of the
                skip list is set to <c>null</c>. As key-value pairs are added to the
                structure, the list head refers to the first header node which in turn
                provides access to a linked list of data nodes as well as access to
                lower levels.</p>

      <title>Searching a Skip List</title>
      <p>The search operation for a skip list will require a key. It will find a
                    data node containing that key and return the corresponding value that is
                    stored in the node. <xref ref="fig-searchskip"/> shows the search
                    process as it proceeds through the skip list looking for the key 77. The
                    nodes marked by stars represent those that are considered during the
                    search process.</p>
      <figure align="" xml:id="fig-searchskip">
        <caption>Searching for the Key 77</caption>
        <image source="Advanced/Figures/searchskiplist.png" width="50%" alt="Searching for the Key 77"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As we search for 77, we begin at the head of the skip list. The first
                    header node refers to the data node holding 31. Since 31 is less than
                    77, we move forward. Now since there is no next data node from 31 at
                    that level (level 3), we must drop down to level 2. This time, when we
                    look to the right, we see a data node with the key 77. Our search is
                    successful and the word <em>of</em> is returned. It is important to note that
                    our first comparison, data node 31, allowed us to skip over 17 and 26.
                    Likewise, from 31 we were able to go directly to 77, bypassing 54.</p>
                  <p>The following code block shows the
                    Java implementation of the <c>search</c> method. The search starts at the
                    head of the list and searches through nodes until either the key is
                    found or there are no more nodes to check. The basic idea is to start at
                    the header node of the highest level and begin to look to the right. If
                    no data node is present, the search continues on the next lower level
                    (lines 4-5).
                    On the other hand, if a data node exists, we compare the keys. If there
                    is a match, we have found a data node with the key we are looking for
                    and we can return its value (lines 7-8).</p>

      <p>Since each level is an ordered linked list, a key mismatch provides us
                    with very useful information. If the key we are looking for is less than
                    the key contained in the data node (line 11),
                    we know that no other data node on that level can contain our key since
                    everything to the right has to be greater. In that case, we drop down
                    one level in that tower (line 12). If
                    no such level exists (we drop to <c>null</c>), we have discovered that the
                    key is not present in our skip list. We break out of the loop and return
                    <c>null</c>. On the other hand, as long as there are data nodes on the
                    current level with key values less than the key we are looking for, we
                    continue moving to the next node (line 14).</p>
      <p>Once we enter a lower level, we repeat the process of checking to see if
                    there is a next node. Each level lower in the skip list has the
                    potential to provide additional data nodes. If the key is present, it
                    will have to be discovered no later than level 0 since level 0 is the
                    complete ordered linked list. Our hope is that we will find it sooner.</p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="advanced_adding-key-value-pairs-to-a-skip-list">
      <title>Adding Key-Value Pairs to a Skip List</title>
      <p>If we are given a skip list, the <c>search</c> method is fairly easy to
                    implement. Our task here is to understand how the skip list structure
                    was built in the first place and how it is possible that the same set of
                    keys, added in the same order, can give us different skip lists.</p>
      <p>Adding a new key-value pair to the skip list is essentially a two-step
                    process. First, we search the skip list looking for the position where
                    the key should have been. Remember that we are assuming the key is not
                    already present. <xref ref="fig-skiplistadd"/> shows this process as
                    we look to add the key 65 (data value <q>hi</q>) to the collection. We have
                    used the stars once again to show the path of the search process as it
                    proceeds through the skip list.</p>
      <figure align="" xml:id="fig-skiplistadd">
        <caption>Searching for the Key 65</caption>
        <image source="Advanced/Figures/addskiplist.png" width="50%" alt="Searching for the Key 65"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As we proceed using the same search strategy as in the previous
                    section, we find that 65 is greater than 31. Since there are no more
                    nodes on level 3, we drop to level 2. Here we find 77, which is greater
                    than 65. Again, we drop, this time to level 1. Now the next node is 54,
                    which is less than 65. Continuing to the right, we hit 77, which again
                    causes us to drop down until eventually we hit the <c>null</c> at the base
                    of the tower.</p>
      <p>The second step in the process is to create a new data node and add it
        to the level 0 linked list (<xref ref="fig-skiplistadd2"/>). However,
                    if we stop at that point, the best we will ever have is a single linked
                    list of key-value pairs. We also need to build a tower for the new
                    entry, and this is where the skip list gets very interesting. How high
                    should the tower be? The height of the tower for the new entry will not
                    be predetermined but instead will be completely probabilistic. In
                    essence, we will flip a coin to decide whether to add another level to
                    the tower. Each time the coin comes up heads, we will add one more level
                    to the current tower.</p>

      <p>We will use the <c>Math.random()</c> method to simulate coin flip, with 0 as tails and 1 as heads.</p>

                    to see if this is the first node being added to the skip list. This is
                    the same question we asked for simple linked lists. If we are adding to
                    the head of the list, a new header node as well as data node must be
                    created. The iteration in lines&#xA0;11&#x2013;19
                    continues as long as the <c>randrange</c> function returns a 1 (the coin toss
                    returns heads). Each time a new level is added to the tower, a new data
                    node and a new header node are created (lines&#xA0;12&#x2013;13).</p>
      <p>In the case of a non-empty skip list
                    (line&#xA0;20), we need to search for the insert
                    position as described above. Since we have no way of knowing how many
                    data nodes will be added to the tower, we need to save the insert points
                    for every level that we enter as part of the search process. These
                    insert points will be processed in reverse order, so a stack will work
                    nicely to allow us to back up through the linked lists inserting tower
                    data nodes as necessary. The stars in <xref ref="fig-skiplistadd2"/>
                    show the insert points that would be stacked in the example. These
                    points represent only those places where we dropped down during the
                    search.</p>
      <p>Starting at line&#xA0;43, we flip our coin
                    to determine the number of levels for the tower. This time we pop the
                    insert stack (line&#xA0;53) to get the next higher insertion point as the tower grows.
                    Only after the stack becomes empty will we need to return to creating
                    new header nodes. We leave the remaining details of the implementation
                    for you to trace.</p>

      <p>We should make one final note about the structure of the skip list. We
                    had mentioned earlier that there are many possible skip lists for a set
                    of keys, even if they are inserted in the same order. Now we see why.
                    Depending on the random nature of the coin flip, the height of the
                    towers for any particular key is bound to change each time we build the
                    skip list.</p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="advanced_building-the-map">
      <title>Building the Map</title>
      <p>Now that we have implemented the skip list behavior allowing us to add
                    data to the list and search for data that is present, we are in a
                    position to finally implement the map abstract data type. As we
                    discussed above, maps must provide two operations, <c>put</c> and <c>get</c>.
                    <xref ref="lst-mapclass"/> shows that these operations
                    can be implemented by constructing an internal skip list
                    collection and using
                    the <c>insert</c> and <c>search</c> operations shown in the previous two
                    sections.</p>

      <title>Analysis of a Skip List</title>
      <p>If we had simply stored the key-value pairs in an ordered linked list,
                    we know that the search method would be <m>O(n)</m>. Can we expect
                    better performance from the skip list? Recall that the skip list is a
                    probabilistic data structure. This means that the analysis will be
                    dependent upon the probability of some event, in this case, the flip of
                    a coin. Although a rigorous analysis of this structure is beyond the
                    scope of this text, we can make a strong informal argument.</p>
      <p>Assume that we are building a skip list for <m>n</m> keys. We know that
                    each tower starts off with a height of 1. As we add data nodes to the
                    tower, assuming the probability of getting heads is
                    <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, we can say that <m>\frac{n}{2}</m> of the keys
                    have towers of height 2. As we flip the coin again, <m>\frac{n}{4}</m>
                    of the keys have a tower of height 3. This corresponds to the
                    probability of flipping two heads in a row. Continuing this argument
                    shows <m>\frac{n}{8}</m> keys have a tower of height 4 and so on. This
                    means that we expect the height of the tallest tower to be
                    <m>\log_{2}(n) + 1</m>. Using our Big-O notation, we would say that
                    the height of the skip list is <m>O(\log (n))</m>.</p>
      <p>To analyze the <c>search</c> method, recall that there are two scans that
                    need to be considered as we look for a given key. The first is the down
                    direction. The previous result suggests that in the worst case we will
                    expect to consider <m>O(\log (n))</m> levels to find a key. In
                    addition, we need to include the number of forward links that need to be
                    scanned on each level. We drop down a level when one of two events
                    occurs. Either we find a data node with a key that is greater than the
                    key we are looking for or we find the end of a level. If we are
                    currently looking at some data node, the probability that one of those
                    two events will happen in the next link is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. This
                    means that after looking at two links, we would expect to drop to the next
                    lower level (we expect to get heads after two coin flips). In any case,
                    the number of nodes that we need to look at on any given level is
                    constant. The entire result then becomes <m>O(\log (n))</m>. Since
                    inserting a new node is dominated by searching for its location, the
                    <c>insert</c> operation will also have <m>O(\log(n))</m> performance.</p>
