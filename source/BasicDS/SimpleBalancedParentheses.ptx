  <title>Basic Balanced Parentheses</title>
  <p>We now turn our attention to using stacks to solve real computer science
            problems. You have no doubt written arithmetic expressions such as</p>
  <p>
    <m>(5 + 6) * (7 + 8) / (4 + 3)</m>
  </p>
  <p>where parentheses are used to order the performance of operations. You
            may also have some experience programming in a language such as Lisp
            with constructs like</p>
  <pre>(defun square(n)
     (* n n))</pre>

  <p>This defines a function called <c>square</c> that will return the square of
            its argument <c>n</c>. Lisp is notorious for using lots and lots of
            parentheses.</p>

  <p>In both of these examples, parentheses must appear in a balanced
            fashion. <term>Balanced parentheses</term> means that each opening symbol has a
            corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly
            nested. Consider the following correctly balanced strings of
            parentheses:</p>
  <pre>(()()()())

(((())))

(()((())()))</pre>
  <p>Compare those with the following, which are not balanced:</p>
  <pre>((((((())

()))

(()()(()</pre>
  <p>The ability to differentiate between parentheses that are correctly
            balanced and those that are unbalanced is an important part of
            recognizing many programming language structures.</p>
  <p>The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of
            parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are
            balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important
            observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent
            opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol (see
            <xref ref="i121_id1fig-parmatch"/>). Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to
            wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match
            opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match
            from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the
            problem.</p>

  <p>Once you agree that a stack is the appropriate data structure for
            keeping the parentheses, the statement of the algorithm is
            straightforward. Starting with an empty stack, process the parenthesis
            strings from left to right. If a symbol is an opening parenthesis, push
            it on the stack as a signal that a corresponding closing symbol needs to
            appear later. If, on the other hand, a symbol is a closing parenthesis,
            pop the stack. As long as it is possible to pop the stack to match every
            closing symbol, the parentheses remain balanced. If at any time there is
            no opening symbol on the stack to match a closing symbol, the string is
            not balanced properly. At the end of the string, when all symbols have
            been processed, the stack should be empty. The Java code to implement
            this algorithm is shown in <xref ref="lst-parcheck1"/>.</p>

<program label="lst-parcheck1" line-numbers="yes" language="java">
    <input>
public class Parentheses {
    public static boolean parenCheck(String symbolString) {
        Stack&lt;Character&gt; symStack = new Stack&lt;&gt;();

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; symbolString.length(); i++) {
            Character symbol = symbolString.charAt(i);

            if (symbol == '(') {
                symStack.push(symbol);
            } else if (symbol == ')') {
                if (symStack.isEmpty()) {
                    return false;
                } else {
                    symStack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                // not a parenthesis; skip over it
            }
        }

        return symStack.isEmpty();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(parenCheck("((()))"));  // expected true
        System.out.println(parenCheck("((()()))"));  // expected true
        System.out.println(parenCheck("(()"));  // expected false
        System.out.println(parenCheck(")("));  // expected false
    }
}

  </program>

  <p>This method, <c>parenCheck</c>, assumes that a <c>Stack</c> class is available and returns a boolean result as to whether the string of parentheses is balanced. If the current symbol is <c>(</c>, then it is pushed on the stack (lines 8&#x2013;9). Note also in line 14 that <c>pop</c> removes a symbol from the stack. The returned value is not used since we know it must be an opening symbol seen earlier. If the stack becomes empty before we reach the end of the <c>symbolString</c>, then there are too many closing parentheses and the string is not balanced, so we immediately return <c>false</c> (line 12). If a symbol is not an open or close parenthesis, we ignore it (lines 16&#x2013;18), which allows more latitude in user input. At the end (line 21), the string represents a correctly balanced sequence of parentheses as long as the stack has been completely cleaned off.</p>
