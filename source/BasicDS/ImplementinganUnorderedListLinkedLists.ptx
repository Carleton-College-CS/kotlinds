  <title>Implementing an Unordered List: Linked Lists</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>In order to implement an unordered list, we will construct what is
            commonly known as a <term>linked list</term>. Recall that we need to be sure that
            we can maintain the relative positioning of the items. However, there is
            no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous memory.
            For example, consider the collection of items shown in
            <xref ref="fig-idea"/>. It appears that these values have been placed
            randomly. If we can maintain some explicit information in each item,
            namely the location of the next item (see <xref ref="fig-idea2"/>), then the
            relative position of each item can be expressed by following the
            link from one item to the next.</p>

    <caption>Relative Positions Maintained by Explicit Links</caption>
    <image source="BasicDS/Figures/idea2.png" width="50%"/>
  </figure>
  <p>It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list
            must be explicitly specified. Once we know where the first item is, the
            first item can tell us where the second is, and so on. The external
            reference is often referred to as the <term>head</term> of the list. Similarly,
            the last item needs to know that there is no next item.</p>
    </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="basic-ds_the-node-class">
    <title>The <c>Node</c> Class</title>
    <p>The basic building block for the linked list implementation is the
                <term>node</term>. Each node object must hold at least two pieces of information.
                First, the node must contain the list item itself. We will call this the
                <term>data field</term> of the node. In addition, each node must hold a reference
                to the next node. <xref ref="basic-ds_lst-nodeclass"/> shows the Java
                implementation.</p>
    <listing xml:id="basic-ds_lst-nodeclass">
        <caption>The Node Class</caption>
        <program language="java">
      <input>
class Node&lt;T&gt; {

    private T data;
    private Node&lt;T&gt; next;

    public Node(T data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;

    <p>To construct a node, you need to supply the initial data
                value for the node. Evaluating the assignment statement below will yield
                a <c>Node</c> object containing the value <c>93</c> (see <xref ref="fig-idea"/>). You
                should note that we will typically represent a node object as shown in
                <xref ref="fig-idea2"/>.</p>
    <pre>
        Node&lt;Integer&gt; temp = new Node(93);
        System.out.println(temp.getData());
    </pre>

    <note xml:id="java-note-private-access">
        <title>Java Note</title>
        <p>We have made the <c>data</c> and <c>next</c> properties <c>private</c>. This means the only way for other classes
            to access and modify these properties is via the <c>getData</c>, <c>setData</c>, <c>getNext</c> and
            <c>setNext</c> methods. This is a common pattern in Java; we <q>hide</q> the properties so that we can
            change the underlying representation of a class; others who use the class can continue to use the same
            methods without having to rewrite their code.</p>
    </note>
    <p>The special Java reference value <c>null</c> will play an important role
                in the <c>Node</c> class and later in the linked list itself. A reference
                to <c>null</c> will denote the fact that there is no next node. Note in the
                constructor that a node is initially created with <c>next</c> set to
                <c>null</c>. Since this is sometimes referred to as <q>grounding the node,</q>
                we will use the standard <q>electrical ground</q> symbol to denote a reference that is
                referring to <c>null</c>. It is always a good idea to explicitly assign
                <c>null</c> to your initial next reference values.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="basic-ds_the-unorderedlist-class">
    <title>The <c>UnorderedList</c> Class</title>
    <p>As we suggested above, the unordered list will be built from a
                collection of nodes, each linked to the next by explicit references. As
                long as we know where to find the first node (containing the first
                item), each item after that can be found by successively following the
                next links. With this in mind, the <c>UnorderedList</c> class must maintain
                a reference to the first node. <xref ref="basic-ds_lst-listclass"/> shows the
                constructor. Note that each list object will maintain a single reference
                to the head of the list.</p>
    <listing xml:id="basic-ds_lst-listclass">
        <caption>The UnorderedList Class</caption>
        <program language="java">
      <input>
class UnorderedList&lt;T&gt; {

    private Node&lt;T&gt; head;

    public UnorderedList() {
        head = null;
    }
</input>
    </program></listing>
    <p>Initially when we construct a list, there are no items. The assignment
                statement</p>
            <pre>UnorderedList&lt;Integer&gt; myList = new UnorderedList&lt;&gt;()</pre>
    <p>creates the linked list representation shown in
                <xref ref="fig-initlinkedlist"/>. As we discussed in the <c>Node</c> class, the
                special reference <c>null</c> will again be used to state that the head of
                the list does not refer to anything. Eventually, the example list given
                earlier will be represented by a linked list as shown in
                <xref ref="fig-linkedlist"/>. The head of the list refers to the first node
                which contains the first item of the list. In turn, that node holds a
                reference to the next node (the next item), and so on. It is very
                important to note that the list class itself does not contain any node
                objects. Instead it contains a single reference to only the first node
                in the linked structure.</p>
    <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-initlinkedlist">
      <caption>An Empty List</caption>

      <caption>A Linked List of Integers</caption>
      <image source="BasicDS/Figures/linkedlist.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The <c>isEmpty</c> method, shown in <xref ref="basic-ds_lst-isempty"/>, checks to
                see if the head of the list is a reference to <c>null</c>. The result of
                the boolean expression <c>this.head == null</c> will only be true if there
                are no nodes in the linked list. Since a new list is empty, the
                constructor and the check for empty must be consistent with one another.
                This shows the advantage to using the reference <c>null</c> to denote the
                end of the linked structure. In Java, <c>null</c> can be compared to
                any reference. Two references are equal if they both refer to the same
                object. We will use this often in our remaining methods.</p>
    <listing xml:id="basic-ds_lst-isempty"><pre>public boolean isEmpty() {
    return this.head == null;
}</pre></listing>
    <p>So how do we get items into our list? We need to implement the <c>add</c>
                method. However, before we can do that, we need to address the important
                question of where in the linked list to place the new item. Since this
                list is unordered, the specific location of the new item with respect to
                the other items already in the list is not important. The new item can
                go anywhere. With that in mind, it makes sense to place the new item in
                the easiest location possible.</p>
    <p>Recall that the linked list structure provides us with only one entry
                point, the head of the list. All of the other nodes can only be reached
                by accessing the first node and then following <c>next</c> links. This
                means that the easiest place to add the new node is right at the head,
                or beginning, of the list. In other words, we will make the new item the
                first item of the list, and the existing items will need to be linked to
                this new first item so that they follow.</p>
    <p>The linked list shown in <xref ref="fig-linkedlist"/> was built by calling
                the <c>add</c> method a number of times.</p>
    <pre>myList.add(31);
myList.add(77);
myList.add(17);
myList.add(93);
myList.add(26);
myList.add(54);</pre>
    <p>Note that since <c>31</c> is the first item added to the list, it will
                eventually be the last node on the linked list as every other item is
                added ahead of it. Also, since <c>54</c> is the last item added, it will become
                the data value in the first node of the linked list.</p>
    <p>The <c>add</c> method is shown in <xref ref="basic-ds_lst-add"/>. Each item of the list
                must reside in a node object. Line 2 creates a new node and places the
                item as its data. Now we must complete the process by linking the new
                node into the existing structure. This requires two steps as shown in
                <xref ref="fig-addtohead"/>. Step 1 (line 3) changes the <c>next</c> reference
                of the new node to refer to the old first node of the list. Now that the
                rest of the list has been properly attached to the new node, we can
                modify the head of the list to refer to the new node. The assignment
                statement in line 4 sets the head of the list.</p>

    <p>The order of the two steps described above is very important. What
                happens if the order of line 3 and line 4 is reversed? If the
                modification of the head of the list happens first, the result can be
                seen in <xref ref="fig-wrongorder"/>. Since the head was the only external
                reference to the list nodes, all of the original nodes are lost and can
                no longer be accessed.</p>

    <p>The next methods that we will implement&#x2013;<c>size</c>, <c>search</c>, and
                <c>remove</c>&#x2013;are all based on a technique known as <term>linked list
                    traversal</term>. <em>Traversal</em> refers to the process of systematically visiting
                each node. To do this we use an external reference that starts at the
                first node in the list. As we visit each node, we move the reference to
                the next node by <q>traversing</q> the next reference.</p>
    <p>To implement the <c>size</c> method, we need to traverse the linked list
                and keep a count of the number of nodes that occurred.
                <xref ref="basic-ds_lst-length"/> shows the Java code for counting the number of
                nodes in the list. The external reference is called <c>current</c> and is
                initialized to the head of the list in line 2. At the start of the
                process we have not seen any nodes, so the count is set to zero.
                Lines 4&#x2013;7 actually implement the traversal. As long as the current
                reference has not seen the end of the list (<c>null</c>), we move <c>current</c>
                along to the next node via the assignment statement in line 6. Again,
                the ability to compare a reference to <c>null</c> is very useful. Every
                time <c>current</c> moves to a new node, we add 1 to <c>count</c>.
                Finally, <c>count</c> gets returned after the iteration stops.
                <xref ref="fig-traversal"/> shows this process as it proceeds down the list.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Searching for a value in a linked list implementation of an unordered
                list also uses the traversal technique. As we visit each node in the
                linked list, we will ask whether the data stored there matches the item
                we are looking for. In this case, however, we may not have to traverse
                all the way to the end of the list. In fact, if we do get to the end of
                the list, that means that the item we are looking for must not be
                present. Also, if we do find the item, there is no need to continue.</p>
    <p><xref ref="basic-ds_lst-search"/> shows the implementation for the <c>search</c> method.
                As in the <c>size</c> method, the traversal is initialized to start at
                the head of the list (line 2). We continue to iterate over the list as long as there are
                more nodes to visit. The question in line 4 asks whether
                the data item is present in the current node. If so, we return <c>true</c> immediately.</p>
    <listing xml:id="basic-ds_lst-search">
        <caption>Searching a Linked List</caption>
        <program language="java" line-numbers="yes">
      <input>
    public boolean search(T item) {
        Node&lt;T&gt; current = this.head;
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.getData().equals(item)) {
                return true;
            }
            current = current.getNext();
        }
        return false;
     }

    <p>As an example, consider invoking the <c>search</c> method looking for the
                item 17.</p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
boolean found = myList.search(17);
System.out.println(found); // prints true
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Since <c>17</c> is in the list, the traversal process needs to move only to the
                node containing <c>17</c>. At that point, the condition in line 4 becomes <c>true</c> and
                we return it as the result of the search.
                This process can be seen in <xref ref="fig-searchpic"/>.</p>
    <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-searchpic">
      <caption>Successful Search for the Value 17</caption>
      <image source="BasicDS/Figures/search.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The <c>remove</c> method requires two logical steps. First, we need to
                traverse the list looking for the item we want to remove. Once we find
                the item, we must remove it. If the item is not in the list, our method
                should throw a <c>NoSuchElementException</c>.</p>
    <p>The first step is very similar to <c>search</c>. Starting with an external
                reference set to the head of the list, we traverse the links until we
                discover the item we are looking for.</p>
    <p>When the item is found and we break out of the loop, <c>current</c> will be a reference to the
                node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One
                possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker
                that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this
                approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of
                items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire
                node.</p>
    <p>In order to remove the node containing the item, we need to modify the
                link in the previous node so that it refers to the node that comes after
                <c>current</c>. Unfortunately, there is no way to go backward in the linked
                list. Since <c>current</c> refers to the node ahead of the node where we
                would like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary
                modification.</p>
    <p>The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we
                traverse down the linked list. <c>current</c> will behave just as it did
                before, marking the current location of the traversal. The new reference,
                which we will call <c>previous</c>, will always travel one node behind
                <c>current</c>. That way, when <c>current</c> stops at the node to be removed,
                <c>previous</c> will refer to the proper place in the linked list
                for the modification.</p>
    <p><xref ref="basic-ds_lst-remove"/> shows the complete <c>remove</c> method. Lines 2&#x2013;3
                assign initial values to the two references. Note that <c>current</c>
                starts out at the list head as in the other traversal examples.
                <c>previous</c>, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind
                <c>current</c>. For this reason, <c>previous</c> starts out with a value of
                <c>null</c> since there is no node before the head (see
                <xref ref="fig-removeinit"/>).</p>
    <p>In line 5 we decide whether to continue the loop or not. We continue if it we haven't reached the end of the list (the first condition) and the item at the current location isn't the one we're looking for (the second condition). If we
                do not find the item, <c>previous</c> and <c>current</c> must both be moved
                one node ahead.</p>
        <p>Again, the order of these two statements is crucial.
                <c>previous</c> must first be moved one node ahead to the location of

                often referred to as <em>inchworming</em>, as <c>previous</c> must catch up to
                <c>current</c> before <c>current</c> moves ahead. <xref ref="fig-prevcurr"/> shows
                the movement of <c>previous</c> and <c>current</c> as they progress down the
                list looking for the node containing the value 17.</p>

    <p>Once the searching step of the <c>remove</c> has been completed, we need to
                remove the node from the linked list. <xref ref="fig-removepic1"/> shows the
                link that must be modified. However, there is a special case that needs
                to be addressed. If the item to be removed happens to be the first item
                in the list, then <c>current</c> will reference the first node in the
                linked list. This also means that <c>previous</c> will be <c>null</c>. We said
                earlier that <c>previous</c> would be referring to the node whose next
                reference needs to be modified in order to complete the removal. In this
                case, it is not <c>previous</c> but rather the head of the list that needs
                to be changed (see <xref ref="fig-removehead"/>). Another special case occurs if
                the item is not in the list. In that case <c>current == null</c> evaluates to <c>true</c>
                and an error is raised.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Line 14 allows us to check whether we are dealing with the special case
                described above. If <c>previous</c> did not move, it will still have the
                value <c>null</c> when the loop breaks. In that case,
                the head of the list is modified to refer to the node after
                the current node (line 15), in effect removing the first node from the linked
                list.</p>
            <p>However, if <c>previous</c> is not <c>null</c>, the node to be removed is
                somewhere down the linked list structure. In this case the <c>previous</c>
                reference is providing us with the node whose next reference must be
                changed. Line 17 modifies the <c>next</c> property of the <c>previous</c> to
                accomplish the removal. Note that in both cases the destination of the
                reference change is <c>current.next</c>. One question that often
                arises is whether the two cases shown here will also handle the
                situation where the item to be removed is in the last node of the linked
                list. We leave that for you to consider.</p>

            <note>
                <title>Java Note</title>
                <p>Line 5 of <c>remove</c> deserves a closer look:</p>
                <pre>while (current != null &amp;&amp; (!current.getData().equals(item))) {</pre>
                <p>We want to keep looping as long as we haven't hit the end of the list and haven't found the item we want to delete. But what if <c>current</c> <em>is</em> <c>null</c>? Why doesn't the <c>getData()</c> call fail? The answer is <term>short-circuit evaluation</term>. When Java evaluates boolean expressions, it works from left to right. As soon as a final result can be determined, Java stops.</p>
                <p>When <c>current != null</c> is <c>true</c>, Java has to evaluate the second condition to determine the result. But when <c>current</c> is <c>null</c>, the first condition returns <c>false</c>. That means that, no matter what the second condition is, the result has to be <c>false</c> (it can only be true when <em>both</em> conditions are true). Java doesn't need to look at the second condition, and immediately yields <c>false</c> for the expression. The <c>getData</c> call never happens.</p>

                <p>In line 10, we wrote the <term>fully qualified name</term> <c>java.util.NoSuchElementException</c>. When a name is fully qualified, you don't need the <c>import</c> statement at the start of the file.</p>

    <p>The remaining methods <c>append</c>, <c>insert</c>, <c>index</c>, and <c>pop</c> are
                left as exercises. Remember that each of these must take into account
                whether the change is taking place at the head of the list or someplace
                else. Also, <c>insert</c>, <c>index</c>, and <c>pop</c> require that we name the
                positions of the list. We will assume that position names are integers
                starting with 0.</p>
    <exercises>
      <title>Self Check</title>
      <p>Part I:  Implement the <c>append</c> method for <c>UnorderedList</c>.  What is the time complexity of the method you created?</p>

      <p>Part II:  In the previous problem, you most likely created an <c>append</c> method that was <m>O(n)</m>  If you add an instance variable to the UnorderedList class you can create an <c>append</c> method that is <m>O(1)</m>.  Modify your <c>append</c> method to be <m>O(1)</m>  Be Careful!  To really do this correctly, you will need to consider a couple of special cases that may require you to make a modification to the <c>add</c> method as well.</p>
