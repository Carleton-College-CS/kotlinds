  <title>Palindrome Checker</title>
  <p>An interesting problem that can be easily solved using the deque data
            structure is the classic palindrome problem. A <term>palindrome</term> is a
            string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, <em>radar</em>,
            <em>toot</em>, and <em>madam</em>. We would like to construct an algorithm to input a
            string of characters and check whether it is a palindrome.</p>
  <p>The solution to this problem will use a deque to store the characters of
            the string. We will process the string from left to right and add each
            character to the rear of the deque. At this point, the deque will be
            acting very much like an ordinary queue. However, we can now make use of
            the dual functionality of the deque. The head of the deque will hold
            the first character of the string and the tail of the deque will hold
            the last character (see <xref ref="i114_id1fig-palindrome"/>).</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Since we can remove both of the head and tail characters directly, we can compare them and
            continue only if they match. If we can keep matching first and the last
            items, we will eventually either run out of characters or be left with a
            deque of size 1, depending on whether the length of the original string
            was even or odd. In either case, the string must be a palindrome. The
            complete method for palindrome-checking appears in
            <xref ref="lst-palchecker"/>.</p>

<note>
<p>If you want to have a double quote appear in a double-quoted string, you must <term>escape</term> it by using the backslash before the internal double quotes.</p>
<p>The test program checks to see that words with an odd number of letters (<em>rotator</em>) and an even number of letters (<em>deed</em>) are handled correctly.</p>
