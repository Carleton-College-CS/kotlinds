        <p>Computer science is the study of problem solving.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both
                    processes and data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a
                    problem domain by hiding the details of the data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Java is a powerful object-oriented language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Arrays and ArrayLists are Java sequential collections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>HashMaps and Sets are nonsequential collections of data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new
                    methods.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Programmers can have multiple methods with the same name as long
          as their number and/or types of parameters differ. This is called overloading a method.</p>
