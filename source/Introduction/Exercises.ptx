        <exercise><p>Implement the simple methods <c>getNumerator</c> and <c>getDenominator</c> that will
                return the numerator and denominator of a fraction.</p></exercise>

        <exercise><p>In many ways it would be better if all fractions were maintained in
    lowest terms right from the start. Modify the constructor for the
    <c>Fraction</c> class so that <c>gcd</c> is used to reduce fractions
    immediately. Notice that this means the <c>add</c> function no
    longer needs to reduce. Make the necessary modifications.</p></exercise>

    <exercise><p>Implement the remaining simple arithmetic operators as methods: <c>sub</c>,
                    <c>mul</c>, and <c>div</c>.</p></exercise>

    <exercise><p>Implement the <c>compareTo</c> method.</p></exercise>

    <exercise><p>In the definition of fractions we assumed that negative fractions
    have a negative numerator and a positive denominator. Using a
    negative denominator might cause some of the comparisons to
    give incorrect results. In general, this is an unnecessary
    constraint. Modify the constructor to allow the user to pass a
    negative denominator so that all of the operators continue to work
    properly.</p></exercise>
